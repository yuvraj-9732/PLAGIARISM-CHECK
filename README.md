## Overview

*[Provide a more detailed overview of your project here. Explain the problem it solves and for whom. What is the main goal? For example: "This project is a web-based recommendation engine that helps users discover new movies based on their viewing history and explicit ratings. It aims to provide more accurate and diverse suggestions than traditional systems by..."]*

## Key Features

*   **[Feature 1]:** *[Brief description of the feature. e.g., "Personalized Recommendations: Generates a unique list of movie suggestions for each user."]*
*   **[Feature 2]:** *[e.g., "Real-time Search: Allows users to instantly search a vast library of movies with auto-complete functionality."]*
*   **[Feature 3]:** *[e.g., "User Profile Management: Users can view their rating history and manage their profile."]*

## Technical Deep Dive

This section details the core technical components that power the project, with a focus on the intelligent systems and computer science fundamentals employed.

### Intelligent Systems Techniques

Our project leverages several intelligent system techniques to achieve its goals.

*   **[Technique 1: e.g., Collaborative Filtering]**
    *   **Purpose:** *[Explain why you used this technique. e.g., "To generate recommendations by finding users with similar tastes."]*
    *   **Implementation:** *[Describe how it's implemented. e.g., "We use a user-item matrix to store ratings. A k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is then applied to find the 'k' most similar users to the active user. Recommendations are generated from the movies that these neighbors have liked."]*

*   **[Technique 2: e.g., Natural Language Processing (NLP)]**
    *   **Purpose:** *[e.g., "To analyze movie synopses and user reviews for sentiment analysis and feature extraction."]*
    *   **Implementation:** *[e.g., "We use a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer to convert text descriptions into a numerical format. This data is then used to calculate content-based similarity between movies."]*

### Core Algorithms & Data Structures

Efficient data handling and processing are critical. The following algorithms and data structures are central to our application's performance.

*   **[Data Structure 1: e.g., Hash Map / Dictionary]**
    *   **Usage:** *[Describe where and why it's used. e.g., "Used for O(1) average time complexity lookups of user profiles and movie data, which is essential for fast data retrieval during the recommendation process."]*

*   **[Data Structure 2: e.g., Graph]**
    *   **Usage:** *[e.g., "The relationship between users and movies is modeled as a bipartite graph. This allows us to reframe the recommendation problem as a link prediction task and potentially use graph traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find related items."]*

*   **[Algorithm 1: e.g., Trie for Search]**
    *   **Usage:** *[e.g., "To implement the real-time search and auto-complete feature, a Trie data structure stores our movie titles. This provides a highly efficient way to find all movies matching a given prefix as the user types."]*

*   **[Algorithm 2: e.g., Quick Sort]**
    *   **Usage:** *[e.g., "Used to sort the final list of recommended movies by their calculated prediction score, ensuring the user sees the most relevant items first."]*

## System Architecture

*[Provide a high-level diagram or description of your system's architecture. For example: "The system follows a client-server model. The frontend is a React single-page application that communicates with a Node.js/Express backend via a REST API. The recommendation logic is handled by a separate Python microservice..."]*

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18.x or higher)
*   npm
*   [Any other requirements, like Python, a database, etc.]

### Installation & Setup

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [your-repo-url]`
2.  Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd is1_project/frontend`
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
4.  *[Add other steps for backend, database setup, etc.]*

## Usage

1.  Start the frontend development server: `npm start`
2.  *[Add steps to start the backend or other services]*
3.  Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing
